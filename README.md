# Handwriting-Recognition
This Python script implements a hand gesture-based volume control system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. It captures live video from the webcam and detects hand landmarks in real-time with MediaPipe's hand tracking solution. The program specifically tracks the tip of the index finger (landmark ID 8) and the tip of the thumb (landmark ID 4). By calculating the Euclidean distance between these two points, it determines whether to increase or decrease the system volume. If the distance is greater than 50 pixels, the volume is increased; otherwise, it is decreased. The script draws hand landmarks and a line between the thumb and index finger for visual feedback. OpenCV handles video capture and rendering, while PyAutoGUI simulates volume key presses. The result is a simple yet effective way to control volume without touching the keyboard or mouse. This can be extended for other gesture-based controls like media playback or brightness adjustment.
