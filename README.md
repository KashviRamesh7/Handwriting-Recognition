# Handwriting-Recognition
This Python script uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to control system volume with hand gestures via webcam. It tracks the thumb and index finger tips, calculates their distance, and increases or decreases volume accordingly. Visual feedback is shown with landmarks and lines in real-time.
